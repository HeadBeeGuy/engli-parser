BRIEF OUTLINE: With their back to the class, students try to guess who is speaking.

DETAILED EXPLANATION:
- Have one student come to the front of the class and stand facing the chalkboard. Point at a random student and have them ask the question, “Who am I?”
- The student facing the chalkboard must guess which student asked the question. They respond by saying, “You are…,” or you could practice ～と思う grammar and have the student respond by saying, “I think you are…”
- If the student guesses correctly, they can return to their seat and the person who spoke replaces them. If they guess incorrectly, choose a different student to speak.
- If the voices are too easy to depict, have the student asking the question try to mask their voice. If it is too difficult, have the student ask the question more than once.

VARIATIONS:

- Try having the students saying different things, for example: reading a sentence, spelling a word, etc.
