BRIEF OUTLINE: Students enjoy matching two parts of a sentence together using relative pronouns.

MATERIALS NEEDED:
ThatWhichMatching attachments: [Daniel's](../Documents/JHS_Textbook_Game_ThatWhichMatching.doc) (original) / [Patrick's](../Documents/JHS_Textbook_Game_ThatWhichMatching_Patricks.doc)

DETAILED EXPLANATION:

- This print doesn't require much explanation. The students will match the beginning of the sentence on the left side with the end of the sentence on the right side.
- If students finish early, have them translate the sentences at the end as an optional challenge. I say "optional" because if you make it mandatory, the lower level students may be discouraged when they don't have time to complete it. This is, of course, up to you.

TEACHING SUGGESTIONS:

- If you have high level students, you can erase the English that's on the translation part so that they have to translate from scratch. Also, feel free to make more difficult sentences for the matching if need be.

TIPS/CAUTIONS:

- This is best used to review the topic. It may be difficult as an introductory lesson.
