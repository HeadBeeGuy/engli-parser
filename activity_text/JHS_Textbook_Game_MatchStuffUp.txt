MATERIALS NEEDED:

-  [MatchStuffUp](../Documents/JHS_Textbook_Game_MatchStuffUp.doc) worksheet and cards: For the cards, there are two sets. One set is objects and one set is actions (verb phrases). You will need enough for five cards per student plus spare cards for those who run out of cards

DETAILED EXPLANATION:

1. Each student receives five actions and five object cards.Students go around the room with their cards and try to score cards off each other by playing Janken using the target dialogue.

2. The winner says a sentence using the ‘Let’s ~’ dialogue. The loser looks at their cards, and if they have a matching object they MUST say a sentence using the ‘Use this ~’ pattern.

3. If the actions and objects do not match, the students move onto a new partner. If they match, the winner receives both cards.

4. If students run out of cards, then they can come to the ALT and receive a complete new set of cards.

5. Students complete the writing activity according the cards they collected.

VARIATIONS:

- If you have spare time you could play a general game like the ball and music game to revise the grammar one more time. Students do the same game structure, only choosing pairs based on with whom the music stops.
- I have also included a back-up worksheet to put on the back of the general worksheet for students who finish early. Students who finish early don’t get bonus points for finishing the other side, but if they finish and just sit there, then I mark their paper and they don’t get any points – lovely and manipulative.

TEACHING SUGGESTIONS:

-  As a warm-up and to target all areas of learning do a warm-up listening dialogue like this one. You can use the attached sheet as a way to grade listening skills. Make sure you use loads of props and act it out. It gets the student’s involved and interested!
- ALT: Today, let’s go to the zoo!
- JTL: Ok! Here, use this car (draw a car on the board).
- ALT: Ok!Oh no, a bad tyre! (scribble over a tyre)
- JTL: Oh no! Use this horse. <pull out a flash card>
- ALT: Thanks! <start ‘riding’ across the classroom>Look! Jusco! <pointing> Let’s eat ice cream for breakfast!
- JTL: Oh really? Ok! <eats ice cream cutout> Yummy! <wipes mouth with a handkerchief and also blows their nose> <ALT spills ice cream/throws it at someone>Oh no! Here, use my handkerchief.
- JTL: Thank you, but I have tissues!

TIPS/CAUTIONS:

-
I tried to get boys and girls to talk together by giving only the boys certain cards and visa versa. This just meant they stood on opposite ends looking at each other and muttering ‘muri, muri’ for the duration of the activity. Instead, maybe get students to choose numbers at the beginning of the lesson which refers them to a group (so maybe only the numbers 1-6). They must talk to everyone in that group FIRST and then they can talk to whoever they like to complete the game. Don’t tell them this until after they have talked to everyone or they just won’t do it.
