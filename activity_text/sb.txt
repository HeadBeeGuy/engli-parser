BRIEF OUTLINE: This is a review activity to enhance students' ability to write past tense questions and practice speaking as much as possible.

MATERIALS NEEDED:

-  [StolenBag](../Documents/JHS_Textbook_Game_StolenBag.doc) handout

DETAILED EXPLANATION:

- After students receive the worksheet (either one per group or each student), read or act out the scenario of Doraemon losing his bag. Then, read the hints and ensure the students understand.
- Together as a class, take the four hints and turn them into questions. Teachers should allow students a few minutes to write the questions before checking for answers. For lower-level classes, tell students to write “Were you...” and insert the bold phrases from the worksheet example sentences. For high-level classes, teachers should consider taking out the bolded areas.
- After practice reading the questions as a class, have students make groups and decide the order to play. Then, show students how to play the game.
- Role Play: The ALT will pretend to be in one of the groups and the first “student” to play. S/he will pretend to memorize the first question and then run to the JTE. You should say, “Anpanman, were you a McDonald's worker?” Then JTE and ALT will play Janken. You [ALT] should purposely lose and then run back to the group. The next student will run to the JTE with the same question, “Anpanman, were you a McDonald's worker?” The student and JTE will play Janken. If student wins, JTE will answer, “Yes, I was.” or “No, I wasn't.” Student will return to the group and share the answer. Then, the next student will go to the JTE with the next question, “Naruto, were you a McDonald's worker?” If student loses at Janken, they return to the group and the next student goes to the JTE with the same question.
- Students need to ask all 16 questions even if they discover the identity of the thief. NOTE: The thief is the person who answers “YES” to all the questions.
- It is recommended that students ask the questions in order from 1-4 about each character. In other words, students should ask question #1 about Anpanman, Naruto, Pikachu and Sazae-san before they ask question #2.
- Reward the groups who complete their worksheets.

TIPS/CAUTIONS:

- To avoid the possibility of students cheating and looking over at other groups' answers, make a chart on the blackboard. Mark off the question # and the character every time the student wins Janken.
- To avoid all members of the same group lining up to read the questions and play janken, give each group a marker or a baton and tell students that only the person holding it can leave his/her seat to go to the teachers.
